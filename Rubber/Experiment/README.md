##### This folder contains the following Matlab scrips and files:


- 'main_Experiment.m' is the main code to solve the rubber problem with experimental parameters.

- 'BGRW_1D.m' is the function for the biased-GRW solution of the diffusion problem 

- 'plot_c.m' plots the solution 'concentration.mat' of the main code. 
	
- 'c.png' and 's.png' are plots of the profile m(x,t) and diffusion front s(t).

- 'plot_c_s_GRW_RW_FEM.m' compares the solutions c(x,t) and s(x,t) contained in .mat files.

- 'comp_c.pdf' and 'comp_s.pdf' compare the solutions m(x,t) and s(t), respectively, obtained with
  GRW, a sequential random walk (RWM), and a finite difference method (FEM).
