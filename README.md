#### Data repository accompanying the paper "Global random walk for one-dimensional one-phase Stefan-type moving-boundary problems: Simulation results" by Nicolae Suciu, Surendra Nepal, Yosief Wondmagegne, Magnus Ã–gren, and Adrian Muntean

##### The repository contains Matlab codes based on Global Random Walk (GRW) algorithms to solve Stefan-like problems, organizsed in the following folders:

- 'Stefan' - classical Stefan problem

- 'Stefan_kinetic' - Stefan problem with a kinetic condition

- 'Rubber' - diffusion in rubber

- FEM_codes - reference FEM solutions
